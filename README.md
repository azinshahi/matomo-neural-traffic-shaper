# Matomo Neural Traffic Shaper

This project connects **Matomo Analytics** with an adaptive AI layer that reshapes website behavior in real time for:
- **Clarity optimization** (auto-adjusts UI if user navigation patterns show confusion)
- **Privacy enforcement** (modifies data tracking to meet user consent)
- **Security balancing** (detects and reduces risky interactions)

### Tech stack
- Python 3.11 (Flask)
- Matomo API
- AI modules for live analytics adaptation

### Folder structure
```
src/ → main Flask application  
ai_config.json → AI behavior configuration  
requirements.txt → Python dependencies  
Procfile → server startup command  
runtime.txt → Python runtime version
```

### Future development
Integration with Matomo’s Reporting and Live APIs to gather real-time visitor data and trigger AI-driven page adjustments.
